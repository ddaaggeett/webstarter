## this is a jumping-off-point for modern web development

### what you get
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): real software, so we're talking server side
- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/): modern web file infrastructure
- [react](https://reactjs.org/): you want user friendly?
- [redux](https://redux.js.org/): app data state container

## how to use

    git clone https://github.com/ddaaggeett/webstarter.git
    cd webstarter/
    npm install
    npm run universal:dev

then visit [http://127.0.0.1:8081](http://127.0.0.1:8081)

if server side (`npm run universal:dev`) development is unnecessary, then run `npm start` instead for front end dev only.
